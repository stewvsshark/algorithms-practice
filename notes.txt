Notes:
- Use things you need to solve a problem - don't worry if it's a little crude.
- Think about what structures to use:
    - hashtables: lookups
    - stacks: add things until you need it all back on some condition
    - lists: general iteration and such
        - circular linked list(?)
    - sets: store a thing exactly once
        - you can store tuples - tuple order matters if storing 'pairs' of things
    - heap: when you need to do some kind of recursive ordering to achieve a result
        - runtime of heap is N*lg(N) -> O(N) if used properly
- Read the question - clarify, ask for examples etc. the subarray problem was confusing
- Are there any preoptimizations that help? For instance if dealing with some operation
    involving an array, would sorting the array first lead to a more efficient solution?
- If you're using while loops, make sure increment your counter!!!!
- Don't think too much - sometimes the solution is simpler, just make sure to understand the question
- Explain your thought process on solving a problem - even if you can't implement the exact solution, the
     compiler is turned off anyways, so just pseudocode it
- Greedy algorithms are probably recursive
